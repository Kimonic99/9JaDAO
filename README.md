# About the project <br>
Web project based on web3 developed with React and ThirdWeb.
In this application, users can be part of the 9jaDAO where they can mint their membership NFT and use the DAO token for decision-making within the 9ja organization.
For this it is necessary to first authenticate using the Metamask wallet and configuring it to use the Goerli testnet.
9jaDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity without central leadership.
Decisions are made from the bottom up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules that are enforced on a blockchain. 
This DAO is developed with 'third web' for making decisions related to Nigerians
It has its own Governance Token and Membership NFT.
